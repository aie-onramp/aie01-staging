## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Cursor IDE
- GitHub account
- Vercel account
- uv (Python package manager)
- OPENAI_API_KEY (set as an environment variable in Vercel)
- Optional: Vercel CLI (only if deploying from terminal):
  ```bash
  npm install -g vercel
  ```


In today's code, we also use several new tools and frameworks:
- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/)

# Build 🏗️

In this session, you'll build an end-to-end LLM application with both frontend and backend, starting from the AIE-challenge repository. You'll create a complete application, test it locally, and deploy both components to Vercel.

- 🤝 [Breakout Room](./BreakoutRoom.md)
    - Create empty GitHub repo
    - Add AIE-challenge as remote
    - Push to your own repo
    - Run locally and test
    - Deploy backend to Vercel
    - Create v0 frontend
    - Test frontend locally
    - Deploy frontend to Vercel
    - Connect frontend to backend
    - Test the complete application

- 🤝 [Assignment](./Assignment.md)
    - Set up repository with AIE-challenge
    - Run and test backend locally
    - Deploy backend to Vercel
    - Generate frontend with v0
    - Test frontend locally
    - Deploy frontend to Vercel
    - Connect frontend to backend
    - Test end-to-end functionality

# Ship 🚢
