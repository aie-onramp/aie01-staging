## Overview

In this demo, we'll:
1. **Use the downloaded frontend in Cursor**
2. **Show multi-agent flow** - demonstrate how we can multitask and make different changes simultaneously
3. **Use branch development and best practices** - work with feature branches
4. **Show on GitHub branches** - visualize the branching structure
5. **Demonstrate merging** - merge branches using best practices
6. **Show the final result in Vercel** - see how changes propagate to production

---

## Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment 🏗️

1. Open the downloaded frontend project in Cursor
2. Ensure you have the latest code from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
3. Verify your app still runs locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## Step 2: Create Feature Branches 🌿

We'll create multiple branches to work on different features simultaneously, demonstrating multi-agent workflow.

### 2.1 Create Branch for Feature 1

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-new-component
git push -u origin feature/add-new-component
```

### 2.2 Create Branch for Feature 2

```bash
git checkout -b feature/improve-styling
git push -u origin feature/improve-styling
```

### 2.3 Create Branch for Feature 3

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-animations
git push -u origin feature/add-animations
```

**Tip:** Each branch represents work that can be done in parallel, simulating a multi-agent workflow where different tasks are handled simultaneously.

---

## Step 3: Multi-Agent Workflow in Cursor 🤖

### 3.1 Work on Feature 1

1. Switch to `feature/add-new-component`:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/add-new-component
   ```

2. In Cursor, use AI to add a new component:
   - Ask Cursor: *"Add a new [component name] component with [specific features]"*
   - Cursor will generate the code following your cursor rules
   - Review and commit:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "feat: add new component"
     git push origin feature/add-new-component
     ```

### 3.2 Work on Feature 2 (Parallel)

1. Switch to `feature/improve-styling`:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/improve-styling
   ```

2. In Cursor, improve styling:
   - Ask Cursor: *"Update the styling for [component/page] to match [design requirements]"*
   - Cursor will apply changes following your coding standards
   - Review and commit:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "style: improve component styling"
     git push origin feature/improve-styling
     ```

### 3.3 Work on Feature 3 (Parallel)

1. Switch to `feature/add-animations`:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/add-animations
   ```

2. In Cursor, add animations:
   - Ask Cursor: *"Add smooth animations to [components] using [animation library]"*
   - Cursor will implement animations
   - Review and commit:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "feat: add animations"
     git push origin feature/add-animations
     ```

**This demonstrates multi-agent workflow:** Different features are being developed simultaneously on separate branches, just like multiple developers working in parallel!

---

## Step 4: View Branches on GitHub 🌐

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the **"branches"** dropdown
3. You'll see all your feature branches:
   - `main`
   - `feature/add-new-component`
   - `feature/improve-styling`
   - `feature/add-animations`

4. Click on each branch to see:
   - The commits made on that branch
   - The files changed
   - The diff view showing what was modified

**This visualizes the branching structure and shows how work is organized.**

---

## Step 5: Merge Branches Using Best Practices 🔀

### 5.1 Merge Feature 1

1. Switch to main and pull latest:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Merge feature branch:
   ```bash
   git merge --no-ff feature/add-new-component -m "Merge feature: add new component"
   ```

3. Push to main:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### 5.2 Merge Feature 2

1. Ensure main is up to date:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Merge feature branch:
   ```bash
   git merge --no-ff feature/improve-styling -m "Merge feature: improve styling"
   ```

3. Push to main:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### 5.3 Merge Feature 3

1. Ensure main is up to date:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Merge feature branch:
   ```bash
   git merge --no-ff feature/add-animations -m "Merge feature: add animations"
   ```

3. Push to main:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

**Best Practices Demonstrated:**
- Using `--no-ff` to preserve branch history
- Meaningful commit messages
- Merging one feature at a time
- Pulling latest changes before merging

---

## Step 6: Clean Up Branches 🧹

After merging, clean up local and remote branches:

```bash
# Delete local branches
git branch -d feature/add-new-component
git branch -d feature/improve-styling
git branch -d feature/add-animations

# Delete remote branches
git push origin --delete feature/add-new-component
git push origin --delete feature/improve-styling
git push origin --delete feature/add-animations
```

---

## Step 7: View Result in Vercel 🌐

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Vercel automatically detects the new commits on `main`
3. A new deployment will be triggered automatically
4. Wait for the deployment to complete
5. Visit your live site - you'll see all the merged features!

**This demonstrates:**
- How changes flow from development → GitHub → Vercel
- Automatic deployments on merge to main
- The complete CI/CD workflow

## 💅 Example: "Hot Mess Tracker" App

> 🌐 **Live Demo:** You can view the deployed app here: [https://v0-hot-mess-tracker-app.vercel.app/](https://v0-hot-mess-tracker-app.vercel.app/)

Here's the complete prompt we'll use in class for our example app:

### App Prompt for v0:

```
Create me an app: "Hot Mess Tracker"

A "self-report" app for chaos level of your day.

Concept:
- Sliders: "Late to class," "Lost charger," "Sent risky text," "Procrastination"
- Animated emoji face reacts as your "hot mess score" increases
- Saves your results and gives sarcastic motivational message like: "At least you're consistently chaotic. We love that for you"

Design Requirements:
- Use the website style similar to: https://www.canva.com/templates/EAFSoi3Ltnc/
- Similar style background
- For buttons, use this style:

import { ArrowUpIcon } from "lucide-react"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export function ButtonDemo() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2 md:flex-row">
      <Button variant="outline">Button</Button>
      <Button variant="outline" size="icon" aria-label="Submit">
        <ArrowUpIcon />
      </Button>
    </div>
  )
}

Color Scheme (for Tailwind CSS):
- murrey: #89023e (hsla(333, 97%, 27%, 1))
- old-rose: #cc7178 (hsla(355, 47%, 62%, 1))
- misty-rose: #ffd9da (hsla(358, 100%, 93%, 1))
- misty-rose-2: #f3e1dd (hsla(11, 48%, 91%, 1))
- tea-green: #c7d9b7 (hsla(92, 31%, 78%, 1))
```

### Tailwind Color Configuration

Add these colors to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'murrey': '#89023e',
        'old-rose': '#cc7178',
        'misty-rose': '#ffd9da',
        'misty-rose-2': '#f3e1dd',
        'tea-green': '#c7d9b7',
      }
    }
  }
}
```
