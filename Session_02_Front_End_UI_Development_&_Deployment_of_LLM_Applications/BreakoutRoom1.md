Welcome! This guide will walk you through two demos that showcase modern development workflows using v0, Cursor, and best practices.

## What Is This Assignment?

This assignment teaches you how to build and deploy modern web applications using AI-powered development tools. You'll learn to leverage v0 (an AI tool for generating frontend code), Cursor IDE (an AI-enhanced code editor), and industry-standard deployment practices with GitHub and Vercel.

**You will master:**
- **AI-Powered Development:** Use v0 to generate complete frontend applications from natural language prompts
- **Professional Workflow:** Implement GitFlow branching strategies and coding standards using Cursor's AI capabilities
- **Multi-Agent Development:** Simulate parallel development workflows by working on multiple features simultaneously
- **Full Deployment Pipeline:** Push code to GitHub and deploy live applications to Vercel with automatic CI/CD

By the end of this assignment, you'll have created, customized, and deployed your own live web application while learning modern development practices that mirror real-world team workflows. The hands-on exercises progress from basic UI customization to advanced multi-branch development, giving you practical experience with the tools and techniques used in professional software development.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) installed
- A GitHub account
- A Vercel account (free tier works great!)
- Node.js installed on your computer (use Mac: 'brew install node', Windows: 'sudo apt install nodejs npm')

# 🤝 Breakout Room #1: Creating and Deploying Your Frontend Application

## Overview

In this session, we'll:
1. **Showcase Cursor rules** by adding GitFlow rules and personal cursor rules (coding styles) to improve collaboration
2. **Showcase v0** - create a vibecode frontend using personal practices
3. **Download and showcase locally** - run the app on your machine
4. **Push to GitHub and deploy** - get your app live on the web

---

## Step 1: Set Up Cursor Rules 📝

### 1.1 Add GitFlow Rules

Set up GitFlow rules to maintain clean version control:

1. Open your project in Cursor
2. Navigate to `gitflow_rules.md` (or create it if it doesn't exist)
3. Add your project-specific GitFlow rules
4. This helps maintain clean version control throughout development

**Example GitFlow rules:**
- Branch naming conventions
- Commit message formats
- Merge strategies
- Release workflow

### 1.2 Add Personal Cursor Rules (Coding Styles)

Set up coding style rules to improve collaboration:

1. Create or update `cursor_rules.md` in your project
2. Add coding standards such as:
   - Code structure & organization
   - Naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)
   - Import paths
   - File size limits
   - Component organization

**Why this matters:** These rules help Cursor understand your coding preferences and maintain consistency across your project, making collaboration smoother.

---

## Step 2: Brainstorm Your Idea 💡

First, you need an idea for your app! You have two options:

**Option A: Use v0 for brainstorming**
- Go to [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)
- Use the chat to explore ideas and get suggestions

**Option B: Use ChatGPT (Recommended)**
- Ask ChatGPT to help you brainstorm app ideas
- Get feedback on your concept
- Refine your idea until you're happy with it

---

## Step 3: Get Your Design Resources 🎨

Now it's time to gather design inspiration and components. You have two paths:

#### Path A: Use v0's Premade Templates
- Browse v0's template library
- Pick a template that matches your vision

#### Path B: Create Your Own Design (More Original!)

**a) Pick a Template Style:**
- Visit [Canva Templates](https://www.canva.com/templates/)
- Find a design style you like
- Note the colors, layout, and overall aesthetic

**b) Choose Component Styles:**
- Go to [shadcn/ui Components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/)
- Browse the component library
- Pick components that match your app's needs (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)

**c) Select a Color Scheme:**
- Visit [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)
- Generate or browse color palettes
- Pick colors that match your app's mood and purpose

---

## Step 4: Create Your v0 Prompt 🎬

Now combine everything into a detailed prompt for v0:

1. Describe your app idea
2. Reference the template style you chose
3. Mention the shadcn/ui components you want to use
4. Include your color scheme
5. Add any specific features or requirements

**Example prompt structure:**
```
Create me an app: [Your App Name]

[Description of your app concept]

Use the design style similar to: [Canva template reference]
For components, use shadcn/ui with: [component names]
Color scheme: [your colors from Coolors]
```

---

## Step 5: Create Virtual Environment 🏗️

Set up your development environment:

1. Open Cursor's terminal
2. Create a virtual environment (if using Python) or ensure Node.js is ready
3. Navigate to your project directory

---

## Step 6: Download Your App from v0 📥

1. In v0, after generating your app, click **"Download"**
2. Copy the download command or use the provided link
3. In Cursor's terminal, run the download command
4. This will create your app folder with all the code

---

## Step 7: Generate README with Cursor 🤖

Let Cursor help you create documentation:

1. In Cursor, ask: *"Create a README.md file explaining how to launch this app"*
2. Cursor will analyze your project structure
3. It will generate a README with setup and launch instructions
4. Review and customize as needed

---

## Step 8: Set Up and Run Locally 🏃

### 8.1 Navigate to App Directory
```bash
cd app
```

### 8.2 Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

This installs all the packages your app needs to run.

### 8.3 Run Your App Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running! Look for a local URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`) in the terminal.

**Showcase your app locally!** Open the URL in your browser and see your creation come to life.

---

## Step 9: Push to GitHub 🐙

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. In Cursor terminal, initialize git (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
3. Add your GitHub repository as remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
   ```
4. Push your code:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

## Step 10: Deploy to Vercel 🌐

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click **"New Project"**
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Vercel will automatically detect your framework
6. Click **"Deploy"**
7. Wait a few minutes, and your app will be live! 🎉

**Your app is now deployed and accessible to the world!**

## 🏗️ Activity #1:

Now it's your turn to experiment and get creative! Use this time to practice what you've learned and explore the tools.

**Experiment with Design Customization:**
- Test out different background styles and color schemes
- Try different button styles and components from shadcn/ui
- Make design changes using v0 to see how it generates updated code
- Practice iterating on your app's visual design
