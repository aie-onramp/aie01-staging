# The AI Engineering Onramp, Cohort 1

Welcome to **The AI Engineering Onramp**, a preparatory course designed to get you ready for [The AI Engineering Bootcamp](https://maven.com/aimakerspace/ai-eng-onramp) from Maven.

This onramp course is specifically designed to prepare you for **The AIE Challenge** and ensure you have the foundational skills necessary to succeed in the fast-paced, demanding environment of The AI Engineering Bootcamp. Our goal is to build your confidence and capabilities in software engineering fundamentals, AI-assisted development workflows, and the technical foundations needed to keep pace with our flagship program.

## 🧑‍💻 What is [AI Engineering](https://maven.com/aimakerspace/ai-eng-bootcamp)?

AI Engineering refers to the industry-relevant skills that data science and engineering teams need to successfully **build, deploy, operate, and improve Large Language Model (LLM) applications in production environments**.

In practice, as of the Fall of 2025, this requires understanding both prototyping and production deployments in the following ways.

During the *prototyping* phase, Prompt Engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Agents, and Fine-Tuning are all necessary tools to be able to understand and leverage. Prototyping includes:

1. Building RAG Applications

2. Building with Agent and Multi-Agent Frameworks

3. Deploying LLM Prototype Applications to Users

When *productionizing* LLM application prototypes, there are many important aspects ensuring helpful, harmless, honest, reliable, and scalable solutions for your customers or stakeholders. Productionizing includes:

1. Evaluating RAG and Agent Applications

2. Improving Search and Retrieval Pipelines for Production

3. Improving Agent and Multi-Agent Applications

4. Monitoring Production KPIs for LLM Applications

5. Setting up Production Endpoints for Open-Source LLMs and Embedding Models

6. Building LLM Applications with Scalable, Production-Grade Components

7. Understanding and Building with Agent Protocols

## 🎯 The Ideal AI Engineering Onramp Student

Our flagship 10-week course, [The AI Engineering Bootcamp](https://maven.com/aimakerspace/ai-eng-bootcamp), has had significant success helping students to become AI Engineers and to achieve their goals in the past two years since we launched in January of 2024.

[The AI Engineering Bootcamp](https://aimakerspace.io/the-ai-engineering-bootcamp/) is an ever-evolving course that keeps pace with the industry.

If you're serious about becoming an AI-Assisted developer, you're in the right place.

However, there have been many students who are ***unsure*** of whether or not they want to pursue engineering and development, or how deeply they'd like to pursue it (e.g., product managers, data scientists, SMEs, former engineers who have become managers and have not written code daily since the rise of AI-assisted development, etc.).

If you fall into this category, this might be a good course for you to test the waters.

However, that's not who the course is built for.

The second contingent of people who we are keen to serve in The AI Engineer Onramp: Vibe-Coding to AI-Assisted development are those who ***are sure*** that they're committed to becoming AI Engineers; they simply do not yet have the reps in on software engineering to be able to come up to speed quickly enough to keep pace with such a demanding course as The AI Engineering Bootcamp.

To clarify, this course is ideal for you if:

- You are committed to becoming an AI Engineer
- You need to build foundational software engineering skills
- You want to gain experience with AI-assisted development tools and workflows
- You're ready to put in the work to catch up to the pace of The AI Engineering Bootcamp
